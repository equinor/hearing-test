# API service

The API service works as an interface to the application's APIs.

## api methods

This will contain helper functions for sending fetch requests and methods you define for each api call.

## mocked api methods

This is a place for you to add mocked versions of the methods you need for your api calls. It contains some simple helper functions and a basic example using mock data from a json file. The demo app has more examples, where mock data is generated randomly using faker.js.
